Disposable
==========

Create a Reddit throwaway account with the click of a button!

Check out the [pre-built Chrome extension][download].

The Disposable chrome extension automatically creates a Reddit throwaway
accounts for you, making the whole process take all of two seconds. Once the
button is clicked, the extension automatically chooses a username for you,
creates an account, and signs you in to Reddit. After this process is done, the
indicator in the popup turns green. If anything goes wrong (like Reddit rate
limiting), the indicator turns red and an error message is displayed.
